# JPACRUDProject

# Overview
<br>
The JPACRUDProject is a webapplication that allows the user to perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete(Destroy) operations<br> on a MySql database table. At the landing page the user<br>
can choose to either search for a specific game by the games unique id or<br> select the game from the table of games on the landing page.
If the user Searches for a specific Id and a game is found<br> all details of the resulting search will be displayed and the user will be prompted to either update the games details, delete the game,<br> or use the navigation bar to leave the page.<br>
On the landing page, the use can either, select a game to view<br>
all details, update, or delete a game.
If the user updates a game, when submitted the updated information<br> will be displayed to the user.<br>
if the user Deletes a game the user will be notified if the operation was successful or if the request failed.
